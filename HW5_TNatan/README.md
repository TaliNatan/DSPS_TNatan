On sections 1 & r of Hogg, Bovy, and Lang (2010):
    In section 1, the authors go over the basic linear algebra that goes into finding the "best fit" values. Ultimately, your fit needs to minimize the chi-squared ("total squared error, scaled by the uncertainties"). In section 5, we discuss the fact that uncertainties are rarely gaussian and while approximating them as gaussian is usually o.k., the best approach is to model them for whatever distribution they are. This mystery distribution /can/ be model, though, with a sum of gaussians with different variences.

For HW#5, I primarily worked by my lonelsome but I did discuss my confusions (naming conventions, good initial guesses, what plots /should/ look like, etc.) with Masooma.
