For our reading component of HW7, we read the introduction of "Judging the Quality of Gene Expression-Based Clustering Methods Using Gene Annotation" by Francis D. Gibbons and Frederick P. Roth. A sentance I really appreciated from this section was: "clustering does not provide proof of this relationship [between genes], but it does provide suggestions that help to direct further research." I liked this idea of clustering not as a way of confirming/diagnosing relationships but as a jumping-off point.

For the coding portion, I worked with:
* Masooma - She answered various clarifying questions early in the assignment
* Shar - They helped me understand the intercluster variance calculation and provided me with a working function I modified for use in my code. They also checked a lot of my early work. 
* Paula - We worked together on the back half of the assignment, especially regarding making and understanding the dendogram.

The gist of this assignment was testing differnt clustering methods (k-means, DBSCAN, agglomerative) and how they appeared on different 2-D projections (t-SNE, UMAP). Further, we visualized our data using a Euclidean distance matrix and dendrograms.
