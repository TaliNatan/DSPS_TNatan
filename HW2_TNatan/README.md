In homework 2, I:
1. investigated the Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution (how to find mean, what is this physically tied to in statistical mechanics)
2. showed the Central Limit Theorem with five different distributions (Normal, Bimodal, Poisson, Chi-Squared, and Gumbel)
    - this entailed showing how the mean of distributions converged towards a value over increasing the sample size
3. read "What we talk about when we talk about AI" by Virginia Dignum (2018)
    - The author cites "the increasing availability of large amounts of data, improved algorithms and substantial computational power" as the reason for AI applicability in recent times
    - Dignum defines AI as "the discipline of developing computer systems that are able of perceiving its environment, and to deliberate how to best act on it in order to achieve its own goals, assuming that the environment contains other agents similar to itself."

For the first two tasks above, I worked with a few colleagues including Paula, Shar, and Masooma. Paula, Shar, and I worked collaborativley through reading docstrings and implementing distributions. I worked with Masooma on getting her Gaussian fitting method to work (I could not figure out why it was not normalized). I also received help from Willow especially with clarifying task 1 and normalizing my histograms in task 2.
