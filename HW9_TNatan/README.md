In the homework, I:
* downloaded the Higgs Doson dataset from Kaggle
* tried out the Random Forest and a Gradient Boosted Tree Classifier
  * made a confusion matrix for each
* tried out the Random Forest and a Gradient Boosted Tree Regressor
  * calculated the L1 and L2 values for each
* found the 4 most important features
* generated an ROC curve plot

I worked with Shar (answered Qs about early problems I was having with the assignment, 
I was really just confused about the goal of each step and how what we did in the 
titanic notebook related, also provided the confusion matrix code), Masooma (answered 
questions about vocabulary of the assignment), andPaula (we worked together on the 
"best features" and "grid optimization" portion, the latter of which she provided code).
I also zoomed with Willow to go over some questions about splitting the data (did I have
to define the test/train split or could I just let the function do it for me), general 
debugging (using a classifier when I needed to use a regressor), and clarification on 
the ROC curve stuff (what does one put in, why, what does the curve mean).
