In the homework, I:
** downloaded the Higgs Doson dataset from Kaggle
** tried out the Random Forest and a Gradient Boosted Tree Classifier
  ** made a confusion matrix for each
** tried out the Random Forest and a Gradient Boosted Tree Regressor
  ** calculated the L1 and L2 values for each
** found the 4 most important features
** generated an ROC curve plot
