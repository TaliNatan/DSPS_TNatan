Part 1:
Bad plot from: "Strong Gravity Extruding Peaks in Speed of Sound Profiles of Massive Neutron Stars" (Cai & Li, 2023). The plot is supposed to show how the squared speed of sound (s^2) varies over the radius of a neutron star given different neutron star equations of state (EOS). Unfortunatly, the plot has a few issues that prevent the reader from fully and quickly understanding the importance of the figure. With respect to what we've discussed in class, the plot fails due to:

* ambiguity:
   * there is no legend to indicate what EOSs the different lines represent
   * the grey and black lines are of similar darkness, it would have been better to use differnt linestyles
* distortion: without subticks on the y axis, it is not immediately apparent tha we are looking at a log/lin plot
* distraction: 
   * figure is riddled with equations that could have been assigned a symbol or roman numeral in the paper that could have been on the paper instead (instead of helpful "data/ink" from Tufte's rules, the equations clutter and dustract from the figure making them "chart junk" instead)
   * addiional "chart junk" on right side of figure (Newtonian to GR arrow)
One thing good about the plot is that all the number, symbols, equations, etc. are a decent size for the figure.

Good plot from: "A rotating white dwarf shows different compositions on its opposite faces" (Caiazzo et al., 2023). The plot shows the lightcurves w/ sinusoidal fits of the white dwarf over different color filters (a) and the binned/phase-folded lightcurve over the same color filters (b). While this plot is not perfect (will explain below), I think it presents the information simply in a way that in intuitivly inderstood by readers.

* ambiguity:
  * data belonging to different color filters is seperated both by color of datapoints (maybe differnt shaped datapoints would help too) and spacially along the magnitude axis such that they would not get confused
  * the units (corrected to zero on the x axis) are immediatly obvious
* distortion: 
  * not too many datapoints such that one cannot tell how much data is present
  * caption of figure is very upfront with how data was treated
  * axis scales both make sense
* distraction: nothing on the figure competes with the importance of the information shown
  
With respect to Tufteâ€™s 5 rules, the "effect size" and "data/ink" are both good (plot has little/needs little "ink"). There is no chart junk. Since we are considering how the data changes over different color filters, the individual lightcurves are small but stacked so that they can immediatly be compared to one another.

Part 2:
I redid the velocity versus distance plot of M31 from HW#4 because I was unhappy with how "ink" was used on the plot, how the errorbars are not easily distinguishabe, and how calling different points "At N * Radius" is dishonest due to rounding to nearest datapoint closest to that number. In changing my figure, I have reduced the amount of "ink" on the plot and instead opted to put that information in the legend or to leave it out and just make the errorbars more obvious. I have also added vertical lines where "N * Radius" falls  on the plot. I think this corrects the previous "lies" of the earlier plot.

The above (updated) plot shows hows the measured velocity (km/s) versus distance from galactic center R (kpc) with systematic and statistical errors. The luminous radius (blue dashed vertical line), two times the luminous radius (red dashed dotted vertical line), and three times the luminous radius (green dotted vertical line) and the data that falls clostest to each of those vertical lines (blue, red, green datapoint) are shown. Over this range of the data, the relationship between V and R looks moderately flat, though slightly decreasing (within error, still flat).
