On sections 1 & 2 of Hogg and Foreman-Mackey (2017):
    The paper first defines Markov Chain Monte Carlo: "Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are methods for sampling probability distribution functions or probability density functions (pdfs)." They state that the MCMC method is ideal for sampling posterior pdfs since it does not require you to calculate the Bayes integral. Further, MCMC is best for ill-normalized or hard-to-sample pdfs. Unsurprisingly then, "the most common use of MCMC is probabalistic inference".
