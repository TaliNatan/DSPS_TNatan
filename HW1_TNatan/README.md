In homework 1, I:
- created a github repo specific to the class
- read the cource code of conduct
- submitted the google form (to share repo link)
- read "What is the Question?" by Jeffery T. Leek and Roger D. Peng (2015)

In that paper, the authors outlined various types of data analysis methods (descriptive, exploratory, inferential, predictive, causal, and mechanistic). They also discussed the importance of knowing the question being asked in a report and whether the data analysis method used to answer this question is a fair method.
