The basis of homework #3 came from "Statistical Tests for Scaling the Inter-Event Times of Earthquakes in California" by Alvaro Corral (2018). The goal of this homework was to understand and reproduce the KS test used in the paper. In addition to this, we were to watch Geoff West's TED Talk entitled "The surprising math of cities and corporations" in which West discussed the need for a "scientific theory of cities." His logic was that since biological phenomina tend to scale like power laws and cities and companies also scale this way, there must be similar laws governing these systems (biological and man-made).

For the code portion of the homework, I worked primarily with Shar Daniels, Paula Galvez Molina, and Rayta Pradata. Shar was a massive help with this assignment specifically with understanding the analysis of Corral (2018) and how to apply that to our dataset. They helped me understand how the inter-event-time cumulative distributions plots were relevent to our work and how to go from data to histogram to the final plots. Parts of the code are from others and this has been noted in the comments but there is a section from Sid Chaini (replacing bad datetime values), Dr. Bianco (for identifying stationary periods), and Shar Daniels (plotting histograms of earthqueake time differences). I also helped troubleshoot Masooma Sarfraz's issues with too-small p-values.
